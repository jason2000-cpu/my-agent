## Code Review: Enhancing Agent Capabilities for Documentation and Output Persistence

### Overall Summary

This change introduces significant enhancements to the `my-agent` project, primarily by adding the capability for the agent to write its output to a markdown file and by providing it with comprehensive documentation guidelines. This greatly improves the agent's ability to deliver actionable and persistent feedback.

### File-by-File Review

#### `index.ts`

**Changes:**
- Imported `writeMarkdownFileTool`.
- Registered `writeMarkdownFileTool` in the agent's `tools` object.
- Modified the initial prompt to instruct the agent to write reviews, suggestions, and documentation to a markdown file in the `../my-agent` directory.

**Review:**
-   **Correctness:** The import and registration of the new tool are correctly implemented. The updated prompt accurately reflects the new functionality and guides the agent to use `writeMarkdownFileTool`.
-   **Maintainability:** This change successfully integrates the new tool, expanding the agent's output capabilities without introducing complexity to the core `index.ts` logic.
-   **Clarity:** The updated prompt clearly communicates the new expectation for the agent's output.

#### `prompt.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added a new section "Documentation Guidelines" to the `SYSTEM_PROMPT`. These guidelines cover clarity, structure, accuracy, consistency, and various other aspects of good documentation.

**Review:**
-   **Clarity & Maintainability:** The addition of detailed documentation guidelines is an excellent enhancement. It provides the agent with explicit instructions on how to structure and content its markdown output, which will significantly improve the quality and usefulness of the generated reviews and documentation.
-   **Consistency:** The guidelines are well-structured and adhere to general best practices for documentation.
-   **Suggestion (Nitpick):**
    -   âœ“ Fixed: There was a numbering skip from `10.` to `12.` in the "Documentation Guidelines" list. Item `12.` has been corrected to `11.` to maintain sequential order.

#### `tools.ts`

**Changes:**
- Imported the `fs` (file system) module.
- Uncommented the `stdout.write` line in `getGitCommitMessageTool` to log the generated commit message.
- Introduced a new tool: `writeMarkdownFileTool`.
    -   This tool takes `content` (a string) as input.
    -   It uses `fs.writeFileSync('README.md', content)` to write the provided content to a file named `README.md` in the current working directory.
    -   It logs "Generated README.md" to `stdout`.

**Review:**
-   **Correctness:**
    -   The `fs` module is correctly imported and utilized by `writeMarkdownFileTool`.
    -   The `writeMarkdownFileTool` successfully writes the given content to `README.md`.
    -   Re-enabling `stdout.write` for `getGitCommitMessageTool` is good for visibility during execution.
-   **Maintainability & Robustness:**
    -   The `writeMarkdownFileTool` is a crucial addition that allows the agent to persist its output, which is highly valuable for code reviews and documentation generation.
-   **Suggestions:**
    1.  **Hardcoded Filename:** Currently, the `writeMarkdownFileTool` hardcodes the output filename to `README.md`. Consider making the filename configurable via an input parameter (e.g., `filename: z.string().default('README.md')`). This would allow the agent to write to different files (e.g., `code_review.md`, `suggestions.md`, or project-specific documentation files) as needed, making the tool more flexible.
    2.  **Error Handling:** The `fs.writeFileSync` call lacks error handling. If there are permission issues or other problems preventing the file from being written, the tool will throw an uncaught exception. It's recommended to wrap `fs.writeFileSync` in a `try-catch` block to handle potential errors gracefully and provide informative feedback to the user or agent.
